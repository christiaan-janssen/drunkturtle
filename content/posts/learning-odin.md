Recently I started looking into the [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) programming language. I was writing a side project in C but got stuck at some point. As I was doing some Googeling and Searching through Youtube I came across the channel from [Karl Zylinski](https://www.youtube.com/@karl_zylinski), specially his tutorial videos about [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) and [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
